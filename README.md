5. Describe two parts of every HTTP request.

   Two parts of every HTTP request are the verb and path. The path is a route to the information the request wants, and the verb is what the request wants to do with that information, ususally GET.

7. How do you describe the difference between HTML and CSS? use an analogy or an example in your answer.

   HTML is the structure of a site, and CSS is the visual styling of the HTML. In a restaurant analogy, the kitchen and business side of the restaurant that the customer doesnt see directly is the HTML, and the front-of-house staff and menus that the customers see and experience are the CSS.

9. How can the chrome dev tools help with writing html and css?

   The Chrome dev tools let you see the HTML and CSS on any website. You can use this as a reference to see how a site does something, and you can make changes to the code to see what the results would be.

11. How do you open the chrome dev tools?

    I usually right click on the page and click inspect.

13. Why is it important to use semantic HTML tags?

    Semantic tags break up and organize your code, and are clearer than everything being in groups all called div.

15. What are the three components of the box model?

    content, padding, border, margin
